# Depowdering

###### by Simon Labunsky, supervisor Prof. Miri Ben-Chen



### Introduction

Powder bed 3D printing is the technology of 3D printing a metal or plastic model by applying glue or laser sintering on a layer of powder. The result is a 3D model inside a bed of powder. The powder is then extracted in a process called "de-powdering" and saved for reuse or discarded.

The goal of this project is to find and implement an algorythm to determine the angles in which the model should be rotated in order to remove all the powder inside.



### The Algorythm

The idea: reach the powder in the deepest parts of the model and work our way out.

The powder is modeled as vertices in a grid graph. the grid should be bigger than the model
